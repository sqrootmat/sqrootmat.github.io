          The Micro City Library was a collection of distinct experiences both programmatically and through its physical realisation. The library was an inverted experience, with open hallways of books sorted by genre and audience housing related programs within its walls. The over design was not a complete library but rather a system; a protocol for growth.<br><br>
          This design studio heavily revolved around the biological terms: genotypes and phenotypes. We used their meanings as a way to abstract and understand precedent buildings and then apply it to our own projects. We applied this process to reveal the genotype, or building blocks, of an architectural library precedent: the DNA of a building, the core abstract concepts that it is trying to convey. Then came the application of these realisations, the visual representations  (phenotype) of the 'building blocks' to create a new architecture for a library.<br><br>
          The site of this project was at Railway Square in Sydney, neither a railway nor a square. Using the site and the knowledge of the City of Sydney public transport infrastructure developments, we laid out a grid to create a field condition for our library. This field condition would be warped and manipulated by thoroughfare and public transportation routes, but retain a consistent gridded language to allow it to be read as a whole.<br><br>

              We set out our manifesto in the form of a non-linear graphic narrative. It follows our hero and protagonist as he ventures into our library and loses all sense of time.

              It was a precisely crafted model at 1:100 scale, featuring laser cut elements, hand-crafted elements and an electroluminescent (EL) panel to provide an interior understanding of the library and its programmatic relations.

            <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure mv0">
              Just over a metre long, this diagrammatic model, while not a direct representation of our designed library, accentuated the modularity and protocol for growth highlighting new permutations and combinations.

          <div class="pa3 bt">
            <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure mv0">
              Our final project model was not place on site nor was it the actual library, but rather, it was a representational model that shared moments from within our library to create character within each space.

            <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure mv0">
              Part of the reason it was a section model was so that we had a flat edge to create a panning video, as can be seen above. This was to create a realisation of the experience of passing through the library from the perspective of a passerby.

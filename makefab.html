        I was brought onboard with Make Fab prior to the launch of the company and was in a unique position to help direct and design UI/UX components. I was responsible for the creation of promotional material, technical documentation and establishing the website. Following the launch I found myself in a feedback loop, noticing how people actually began to interact with the material and where things could continually be improved. It taught me that it was not enough to simply design the components, but to remain dynamic and adapt to the requirements of the users.<br><br>
        During my time at Make Fab, I continued to take initiative and improve on areas that would result in smoother workflows both for my colleagues but also our users and clients. This involved learning new tools such as Zapier (online automation service), Typeform (improving our quote experience), Trello (pairing with Zapier to clearly identify job progress), Xero (online invoicing service) and Excel (developing a quoting template to work alongside Xero).<br><br>
        One major change that I was responsible for was the development of a new laser cutting template which I developed by analysing the pain points of my colleagues and the common problems that our users were experiencing. The new template catered to users of all experience levels, simplifying the process and reducing the time spent emailing back and forth.

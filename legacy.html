          My legacy project was conducting an elective on 'Developing Technical Skills for your Portfolio' as part of Professional Practice at the Cutting Edge (PPCE). I recognised the growing importance to have the ability to show future employers what we do as transdisciplinary innovators. Having made physical portfolios in the past, I find that web portfolios and web presence in general have a wider reach and greater visibility in real-time. With this objective in mind, I designed this elective for 4th Year BCII students as a tool to market their transdisciplinary skills and enhance their career prospects.<br><br>
          While designing the elective, I took into consideration that people are from different disciplinary backgrounds and have different levels of understanding. The elective was designed as a practical tutorial where the hands-on aspect meant it was ideal for people to “learn by doing”. This experience along with the inclusion of templates at the end helped in achieving a deep impact where the interactive learning could continue beyond the class.

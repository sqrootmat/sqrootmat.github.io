          This project received backing from the Faculty of Transdisciplinary Innovation and has been developed following the handover. It is currently undergoing bug and security testing before being rolled out to students, staff and alumni.<br><hr>

          Over the course of this year, we have been developing a platform for the Faculty of Transdisciplinary Innovation (FTDi) to foster the valued connections between students, alumni, staff and industry. It is more than just a network: it is a transdisciplinary ecosystem, a place where students can showcase their projects, staff can collaborate with students, alumni can stay connected, and industry can search for the best new talent.<br><br>
          Our solution works in a complex opportunity space that adds values to all stakeholders. Each stakeholder has multiple interactions across the system through reciprocal and organic exchange. For example, industry has the ability to search for talent, but also collaborate on student projects; conversely, those students can find jobs but also propose new ideas to industry.<br><br>
          In the history of UTS, no faculty has ever successfully collected and analysed the information from the first cohort through to its present years. FTDi has the unique opportunity  to gather a rich and holistic understanding of the progression of the degrees and graduates from day one.
